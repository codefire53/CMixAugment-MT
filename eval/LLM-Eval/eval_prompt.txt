Evaluation Prompt

You will be given one Hindi-English translation written for an English sentence.
Your task is to rate the overall translation score based on given three different metrics.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Adequacy (1-5) - this metric measures how well the translated text captures the meaning of the original English sentence. A score of 5 indicates a perfect match in meaning, while a score of 1 suggests that the translation has missed the essence of the original sentence completely.
Grammar (1-5) - this evaluates the grammatical correctness of the translation in both languages. A score of 5 means the translation is grammatically flawless in both Hindi and English, whereas a score of 1 indicates significant grammatical errors.
Naturalness (1-5) - this assesses how naturally the translation reads in the target language, in this case, English. A score of 5 suggests that the translation reads as if it were originally written in English, with no awkwardness or unnatural phrasing. A score of 1, however, would indicate that the translation feels forced or directly translated, lacking the fluency and ease of natural speech.

Evaluations Steps:
Read the Original Sentence and the Translation: Begin by thoroughly reading both the original English sentence and its Hindi translation. Ensure you understand the intended meaning of the original sentence.
Rate Adequacy: Reflect on how well the translated sentence captures the essence and specifics of the original sentence. Consider if any key information is lost, added, or misrepresented in the translation.
Rate Grammar: Assess the grammatical accuracy of the translated sentence in both languages. Pay attention to syntax, verb conjugations, noun-adjective agreement, and the correct use of prepositions and articles.
Rate Naturalness: Determine how naturally the translated sentence reads. Consider if the sentence structure and word choices feel authentic to a native speaker, or if they seem awkward or directly lifted from the source language.
